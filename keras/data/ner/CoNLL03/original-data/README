The data provided at http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2003/ner/ needs to
be combined with the Reuters corpus text, which requires a separate
license.

As the Reuters corpus was not available to us at the moment, I decided
to see if the combined data was available online and found this at

    https://github.com/synalp/NER/tree/master/corpus/CoNLL-2003

A quick check suggests that this is indeed the combined CoNLL'03
English corpus data. However, a careful check will be required to
be sure, and we'll probably want to license the Reuters corpus in
any case.
