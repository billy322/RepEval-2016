# The CoNLL'00 data (http://www.cnts.ua.ac.be/conll2000/chunking/)
# does not include a separate development subset. To create the
# train/devel split, the original train.txt was split to 3/4 train
# and 1/4 devel as follows

head -n 165501 train.txt > original-data/train.txt
tail -n +165502 train.txt > original-data/devel.txt
